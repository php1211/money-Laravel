Money

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/moneyphp/money.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/moneyphp/money)

PHP 5.4+ library to make working with money safer, easier, and fun!

> "If I had a dime for every time I've seen someone use FLOAT to store currency, I'd have $999.997634" -- [Bill Karwin](https://twitter.com/billkarwin/status/347561901460447232)

In short: You shouldn't represent monetary values by a float. Wherever
you need to represent money, use this Money value object.

```php
<?php

use Money\Money;

$fiveEur = Money::EUR(500);
$tenEur = $fiveEur->add($fiveEur);

list($part1, $part2, $part3) = $tenEur->allocate(array(1, 1, 1));
assert($part1->equals(Money::EUR(334)));
assert($part2->equals(Money::EUR(333)));
assert($part3->equals(Money::EUR(333)));
```
