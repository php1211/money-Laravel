PHP 5.5+ library to make working with money safer, easier, and fun!

> "If I had a dime for every time I've seen someone use FLOAT to store currency, I'd have $999.997634" -- [Bill Karwin](https://twitter.com/billkarwin/status/347561901460447232)

In short: You shouldn't represent monetary values by a float. Wherever
you need to represent money, use this Money value object. Since version
3.0 this library uses [strings internally](https://github.com/moneyphp/money/pull/136)
in order to support unlimited integers.

```php
<?php

use Money\Money;

$fiveEur = Money::EUR(500);
$tenEur = $fiveEur->add($fiveEur);

list($part1, $part2, $part3) = $tenEur->allocate(array(1, 1, 1));
assert($part1->equals(Money::EUR(334)));
assert($part2->equals(Money::EUR(333)));
assert($part3->equals(Money::EUR(333)));
```

Contributing
------------

We would love to see you helping us to make this library better and better. Please keep in mind we do not use suffixes
and prefixes in class names, so not `CurrenciesInterface` but `Currencies`. Other that, Style CI will help you using the
 same code style as we are using. Please provide tests when creating a PR and clear descriptions of bugs when filing
 issues.

This library is heavily inspired by Martin Fowler's Money pattern. A special remark goes to Mathias Verraes, without his
contributions, in code and via his blog, this library would be where it stands now.
